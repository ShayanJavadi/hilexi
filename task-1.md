# Boring stuff to get to fun
You'll have a playground to make dope stuff by the end of this task!
Don't get bogged down on specifics of these tools for now. they're just a means to an end :)

## Tools!
* Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Download [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
* Verify by running  `brew -v`
* Download [Node](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/node)
* Verify you have node `node -v`
* Verify you have npm `npm -v` (npm is a tool that comes with Node)

Ok! Almost there.

## Fast track to the good stuff
* Navigate to where this repo is at in your terminal
* run `npx create-react-app playground` (it'll take a minute)
* run `cd playground`
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`

You should have a browser tab opened for you (probably localhost:3000) once everything is done!
Now you've got your playground set up 

## Commit!
Commit everything to the remote (github in this case) by doing: 
`git add .`
`git commit -m "your commit message. it could be anything"`
`git push` 

yay! done! ready for fun!
